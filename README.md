Boot the Space
==============

Ideas for building mid-term sustainable businesses in space. Because not enough people are thinking about immediate expansion of the space economy.

(Mid-term: 10y-15y to "market" - deployed and first user. Let's assume a budget of $100M. Should be able to break even in 20-25y assuming continuous expansion of space usage.)

*Profitability:* Consider heavy carbon taxation on Earth. Also, let's assume concurrent existence and growth of other space users.

Space transportation is a general prerequisite. We probably don't want to compete with SpaceX. We assume that in 5 years, commercial lunar payloads will be available.
(But we will need to make price projections at some point in economic analyses.)


### Lunar In-Situ Solar Cell Production

Extract and purify Silicon from regolith to produce solar cells at massive scale on lunar surface.

Efficiency doesn't seem critical. Simplicity of the manufacturing process seems key. How to deal with gas inputs?

Consider microwave transmission as power delivery interface.

*Prereq:* ???

*Value:*
* Can produce power immediately and either (A) sell it to other lunar projects; (B) deliver it to Earth as zero-carbon energy; (C) use it to build more solar cells. :)
* This is a primitive predecessor of chip production.


### Lunar Datacenters

Run compute-intensive datacenters on the moon (e.g. bitcoin mining, model training, simulations). Bitflip-resilient workloads are a plus. :)

*Prereq:* Lunar In-Situ Solar Cell Production. Lunar underground construction. Lunar broadband.

*Value:*
* Uses zero-carbon energy. Makes sense only if solar is significantly more practical than on Earth. (Contingency plan in case of a political failure of nuclear.)
